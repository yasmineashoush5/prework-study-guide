## Description

This website was created for the bootcamp students who was doing the prework.It contains an introduction about four of the most important wellknown programming languages; HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
I built this website as a reference for the bootcamp students, where they could find all the information they receive in the course in one place. 
This website could be a tool for managing and organizing all the data in one place.
I learned that the programming languages could be challenging, interesting and exciting at the same time. I also practiced problem-solving when I face a challenge.
